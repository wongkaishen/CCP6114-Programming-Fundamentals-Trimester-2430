2. C++ Compiler Code::Blocks integrates with several C++ compilers, and it is essential to have a working compiler for building the project. The following are compatible compilers:
  ● MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows): For Windows users
  ● GCC: For Linux/macOS users
  ● Clang: Compatible with macOS and Linux systems
  Required Compiler Version:
  ● GCC: Version 9.0 or later
